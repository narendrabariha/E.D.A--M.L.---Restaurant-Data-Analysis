# E.D.A--M.L.---Restaurant-Data-Analysis
project EDA

🔍 Explored dataset: identified dimensions, missing values, and performed necessary data preprocessing.

📊 Conducted descriptive analysis: calculated statistical measures, explored distribution of categorical variables, and identified top cuisines and cities.

🗺️ Performed geospatial analysis: visualized restaurant locations on a map and analyzed their distribution across cities.

🍽️ Analyzed table booking and online delivery: determined percentages, compared ratings, and analyzed delivery availability based on price range.

💰 Conducted price range analysis: identified common price range, calculated average ratings, and determined color representation for highest rating.

🛠️ Engaged in feature engineering: extracted additional features, created new binary features, and prepared data for predictive modeling.

📈 Built predictive regression model: split dataset, trained various algorithms, and evaluated model performance.

🍔 Explored customer preferences: analyzed cuisine-rating relationship, identified popular cuisines based on votes, and examined cuisine-rating correlation.

📊 Visualized data: created visual representations for rating distribution, compared average ratings, and explored feature-target relationships.


🚀 Excited to announce the completion of the Restaurant Data Analysis project at Cognifyz Technologies!
